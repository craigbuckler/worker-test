[Publican v0.10.0](https://www.npmjs.com/package/publican) was released on <time datetime="${{ tacs.fn.format.dateISO( '2025-06-08' ) }}">${{ tacs.fn.format.dateHuman( '2025-06-08' ) }}</time>.

There are no breaking changes, but the following features have been improved and a new [static site search engine](#introducing-staticsearch) is available.


## Better performance logging

Previous releases of Publican could conflict with other applications recording [Node.js `performance` metrics](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/perf_hooks.html). This has been fixed using [PerfPro](https://www.npmjs.com/package/perfpro) -- a new profiler that namespaces applications so records cannot clash.

Publican and related tools such as [LiveLocalhost](https://www.npmjs.com/package/livelocalhost) and [StaticSearch](https://www.npmjs.com/package/staticsearch) have also adopted [ConCol](https://www.npmjs.com/package/concol) for prettier and less cluttered console logging:

## Introducing StaticSearch

This site is fairly large. While it offers reasonable navigation and [tags](--ROOT--tag/), finding the page you want can be tricky.

Static sites cannot easily provide search facilities because there's no back-end database. You can integrate a third-party search service such as [Alogia](https://www.algolia.com/), [AddSearch](https://www.addsearch.com/), or [Google's Programmable Search Engine](https://programmablesearchengine.google.com/). These index your site and provide a search API, but have an ongoing cost.

JavaScript-only search facilities such as [Lunr](https://lunrjs.com/) require you to pass all content in a specific format. Every page then has a full index of your site, so the payload can become large as your site grows.

My preferred option is [pagefind](https://pagefind.app/). This analyses your built site and creates WASM binary indexes. Unfortunately, it can require some configuration, produces quite large files, and has problems with [Content Security Policies](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Guides/CSP) and Safari compatibility.

*So I've rolled my own...*

[StaticSearch](https://www.npmjs.com/package/staticsearch) is my new search engine for static sites. It's enabled on Publican.dev: click the search icon in the header or press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> | <kbd>Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>K</kbd>.

StaticSearch is easy to use and fully compatible with Publican, but you can use any static site generator. It:

1. quickly indexes built HTML (like pagefind)
1. is pure JavaScript without any CSP issues, and
1. has a tiny payload and no AI nonsense.

At most, the search facility requires 13Kb of JavaScript and 4Kb of CSS. You can reduce that to just 6Kb if you're building your own UI. Word index data typically totals:

* 100Kb for a 100 page site
* 800Kb for a 1,000 page site.

Index data is incrementally loaded on demand as you search for different words. Indexes are cached in [IndexedDB](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pixdb) so results appear faster the more searches you do.


### StaticSearch quickstart

Assuming your static site has been generated in a sub-directory named `./build/`, run StaticSearch using:

```bash
npx staticsearch
```

It creates a new directory named `./build/search/` containing JavaScript code and index data.

If your site is in a different directory, such as `./dist/`, use:

```bash
npx staticsearch --builddir ./dist/ --searchdir ./dist/search/
```

You can now add a search facility to the site using HTML code on any/all pages:

```html
<script type="module" src="/search/staticsearch-component.js"></script>

<static-search>
  <p>search</p>
</static-search>
```

Any HTML element can be placed inside `<static-search>` to activate the search when it's clicked. You may then need to rebuild your site and re-run `staticsearch` to ensure everything's up to date.

StaticSearch is new -- full documentation will appear on [Publican.dev](--ROOT--) shortly.


## Minor redesign of Publican.dev

This site's been updated to provide search and reduce the clutter in the header.


## Get started

The [Publican documentation](--ROOT--docs/) provides a [quick start guide](--ROOT--docs/quickstart/concepts/), a [detailed set-up guide](--ROOT--docs/setup/content/), [API references](--ROOT--docs/reference/publican-options/), and [common recipes](--ROOT--docs/recipe/) you can use and adapt for your own projects.
