[Publican v0.10.2](https://www.npmjs.com/package/publican) and [StaticSearch v0.4.0](https://www.npmjs.com/package/staticsearch) were released on <time datetime="${{ tacs.fn.format.dateISO( '2025-06-25' ) }}">${{ tacs.fn.format.dateHuman( '2025-06-25' ) }}</time>.

There should be no breaking changes.


## Publican string replacement issue

Publican allows you to define content [string replacements](--ROOT--docs/reference/publican-options/#string-replacement). Previous releases would run the replacement twice when content was rendered inside a template. This didn't normally cause a problem:

{{ `publican.config.js` excerpt }}
```js
publican.config.replace.set('Hi', 'Hello');
```

However, it would matter when the replacement *included* the search string:

{{ `publican.config.js` excerpt }}
```js
publican.config.replace.set('Hi', 'Hi there');
```

`Hi` becomes `Hi there` which then becomes `Hi there there`!

Version `v0.10.2` fixes this so string replacement occurs once.


## StaticSearch v0.4.0 updates

The following features have been added or improved:

1. [Document indexing](--ROOT--tools/staticsearch/search-indexer/#document-indexing-options) has been improved so content can be identified even when a page does not have a `<main>` element.

1. You can set a [log verbosity level](--ROOT--tools/staticsearch/search-indexer/#logging-options).

1. When no search directory is set (`--searchdir`), it defaults to a `search` sub-directory in the build directory (`--builddir`).

1. An issue was fixed where pages were not indexed because a `noindex` reference was found inside minified HTML even though it was outside a `<meta name="robots">` tag.

1. The README now points to the comprehensive [Publican.dev StaticSearch documentation](--ROOT--tools/staticsearch/).
