Publican is a new HTML first static site generator for Node.js. The first usable 0.4.0 beta release is on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/publican) and [Github](https://github.com/craigbuckler/publican).


## Not another one!

There are plenty of great static site generators, but few provided all the features I wanted. So, yeah, [I created my own](--ROOT--news/why-another-ssg/).


## Use at your own risk!

I've been working on Publican since late 2024 and it's small but stable. This site is built using it, but I'm the only developer and it's unlikely to be as robust as I hope.

You can [use Publican without restriction](--ROOT--about/licence/) at your own risk.


## Get started

The [Publican documentation](--ROOT--docs/) provides a [quick start guide](--ROOT--docs/quickstart/concepts/), a [detailed set-up guide](--ROOT--docs/setup/content/), [API references](--ROOT--docs/reference/publican-options/), and [common recipes](--ROOT--docs/recipe/) you can use and adapt for your own projects.

</ul>


## Coming soon...

Publican templates for basic blogs, starter projects, and full documentation systems similar the one on this site.
