I've not heavily publicised Publican.

* I've been working on the code and the documentation. I wanted Publican to be useable before too many developers tried it.
* *I find promotion tedious!* A couple of links on [X.com](https://x.com/craigbuckler/status/1882820576320131353) and [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/craigbuckler.com/post/3lgirbcxrfc2t) is as far as I got.

Somehow, the writers of the [Node.js Weekly Newsletter](https://nodeweekly.com/) found and [featured Publican.dev in issue 565](https://nodeweekly.com/issues/565).

I've written a [lot of articles](https://www.sitepoint.com/author/craig-buckler/) over the years, but it's always a thrill to see someone link to your work. For a brief moment, site traffic spiked from 20 to 150 visitors per hour. Sure, that's still not many but the site's new and Google is yet to fully index it.

If you like or use Publican, please:

* add links from your site to [publican.dev](--ROOT--), or
* [share pages online](#share).

If you'd like more information for an article or tutorial, please email <a href="https://craigbuckler.com/" class="email">info {at} publican dot dev</a>.
